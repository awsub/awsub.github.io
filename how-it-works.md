> This page describes how `hotsub` works on cloud services, such as AWS.

# Example

As it's described in [Getting Started](/getting-started#2-hello-world), you can run a script on cloud instances by `run` command.

```
% hotsub run \
  --script hello.sh \
  --tasks hello.csv \
  --verbose
```

it will show following logs

Here explains what each step does and how it works.

# Lifecycle Overview

Basic lifecycle of `hotsub` execution is constructed by following steps.

1. Command parsing
2. `[CREATE]`[*](#create): starting up VMs on cloud services (AWS EC2, by default)
3. `[CONSTRUCT]`[*](#construct): starting up Docker containers on the VMs
4. `[FETCH]`[*](#fetch): downloading input files specified in `tasks` CSV file
5. `[EXECUTE]`[*](#execute): processing specified `script` file on the Docker containers
6. `[PUSH]`[*](#push): uploading output files to the URL specified in `tasks` CSV file
6. `[DESTROY]`[*](#destroy): terminating VM instances no longer used

# [CREATE]

`[CREATE]` step creates VM instances on cloud services, which is specified with `--provider` option (`aws` by default).
The number of VM instances are defined by **the rows of task CSV file**, it means when the following CSV is given

```csv
--env NAME, --env AGE, --env NATIONALITY
Hiromu, 32, Japan
Tainaka, 17, Japan
```

this CSV will create **2 VM instances** because 2 samples are specified excepting for header row.

{% include note.html type="info" content="`hotsub` uses [`docker-machine`](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) for `[CREATE]` step, this is why you need to install `docker-machine` as one of prerequisites." %}

<br>

# [CONSTRUCT]

After creating VM instances, `[CONSTRUCT]` step sets up Docker containers inside the VMs.
By using separated Docker containers inside 1 VM instance, `hotsub` enables to run ****any script**** on VM instances ****without caring**** about neither downloading input files nor uploading output files.

<br>

# [FETCH]

The containers are still empty, then `[FETCH]` step will download input files assigned to each VM instance.

For example, when following CSV is given (1 column CSV to make it simple ;)

```
--input BAMFILE
s3://my-bucket/path/case_XXX/sorted.bam
s3://my-bucket/path/case_ZZZ/sorted.bam
```

As described before `[CREATE]` step creates 2 VM instances for `case_XXX` and `case_ZZZ`, and `[FETCH]` step downloads those files from S3 (in this example) and locate them in specific file path in each VM.

**The file locations can be accessed as env variables represented by column names**, e.g. env var `$BAMFILE` specifies the location of downloaded `sorted.bam` in each VM.

<br>

# [EXECUTE]

Thus your script given with `--script` does not need to care about downloading input files and can just access those files with environment variables, like this

```sh
bwa mem \
    -t 2 -T 0 \
    ${REFERENCE}/${REFERENCE_FILE} \
    ${FASTQ_1} ${FASTQ_2} \
    > ${DEST}/result.sam

# From https://github.com/otiai10/hotsub/tree/master/examples/BWA
```

The only thing this script should care about is **to place output files at directory specified with `--output-recursive`**, all the files placed that directory are going to be uploaded by the next step: `[PUSH]`

<br>

# [PUSH]

Once `[EXECUTE]` step succeeded, `[PUSH]` step will upload the files located under the directories specified with the column name of `--output-recursive` to the location specified by the values of columns.

For example,

```
--output-recursive OUTDIR
s3://my-bucket/path/case_XXX/out
s3://my-bucket/path/case_ZZZ/out
```

if `[EXECUTE]` step any files under the location `$OUTDIR`, able to access as env var same as `--input`, that will be pushed to specified URLs from each VM.

# [DESTROY]

Even if `[EXECUTE]` succeeded or failed, because it's not good idea to keep the instance alive, `[DESTROY]` step will be called and terminates all the VM instances **to keep your cloud account NOT CHARGED**.
