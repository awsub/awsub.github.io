> This page describes how `hotsub` works on cloud services, such as AWS.

# Example

As it's described in [Getting Started](/getting-started#2-hello-world), you can run a script on cloud instances by `run` command.

```
% hotsub run \
  --script hello.sh \
  --tasks hello.csv \
  --verbose
```

it will show following logs

Here explain what each step does and how it works.

# Lifecycle


First, you can see your task file (`csv`) is parsed as 2 tasks, because it has 2 rows except for the header row, and the log folder specified.

After that, each color represents each VM's lifecycle. It `CREATE` each VM, `CONSTRUCT` containers in it, `EXECUTE` the shell script you specified, and finally it `DESTROY` so that nothing remains after your jobs get done.
