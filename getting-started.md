> This page describes how to get started with `hotsub` command. 

# 0. Prerequisites

You need 2 softwares install on your environment

- [docker-machine](#install-docker-machine)
- [AWS CLI](#install-aws-cli)

and 2 permissions on AWS account

- [EC2 Full Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_ec2_region.html) // TODO: fix
- [IAM Full Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) // TODO: fix

{% include note.html type="info" content="These 2 permissions are **sufficient condition**. Check ['Support HIPAA'](/support-hipaa) for more detail." %}

## Install docker-machine

You can skip this step if following command already works well on your computer.

```sh
% docker-machine version
```

Otherwise, you need to install `docker-machine`.

- [Install Docker Machine - Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/){:target="_blank"}
- **or** [Docker Toolbox overview - Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview)

## Install AWS CLI

You can skip this step if following command already works well on your computer.

```sh
% aws configure list
```

Otherwise, you need to install `awscli` and configure it with your credentials.

- **and** [Configuring the AWS CLI - AWS Command Line Interface ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html){:target="_blank"}

# 1. Install hotsub

{% include note.html type="info" content="`hotsub` is currently stable on MacOS and Linux environment. Windows support is coming soon." %}

Choose binary for your OS from [this release page](https://github.com/otiai10/hotsub/releases) and, if you want, locate extracted executable file to your `PATH`.

# 2. Hello World!

You can generate `Hello, World` project by using `template` command.

```sh
% hotsub template
Successfully created template project
    at helloworld_201810041451
Go to the directory and check README.md
% cd helloworld_201810041451
% ls
README.md	hello.csv	hello.sh
```

These are all you need to run `Hello, World`

```sh
% hotsub run \
    --script hello.sh \
    --tasks hello.csv \
    --verbose
```

Then you will get following output

```

```

`hello.sh` and `world.csv` are [like this](https://gist.github.com/otiai10/4dd9214d01ec933cb98204e426bf2c44){:target="_blank"}. You can just download these files to try.

When it works well, it will show you output like this

Let's read the log of this "Hello, World".

First, you can see your task file (`csv`) is parsed as 2 tasks, because it has 2 rows except for the header row, and the log folder specified.

After that, each color represents each VM's lifecycle. It `CREATE` each VM, `CONSTRUCT` containers in it, `EXECUTE` the shell script you specified, and finally it `DESTROY` so that nothing remains after your jobs get done.
