> This page describes how to get started with `awsub` command. 

# Prerequisites

- [aws cli](#install-aws-cli)
- [docker-machine](#install-docker-machine)

## Install aws cli

You can skip this step if following command already works well on your computer.

```sh
% aws configure list
```

Otherwise, you need to install `awscli` and configure it with your credentials.
